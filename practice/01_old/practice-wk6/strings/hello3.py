# The first line of code in this program is
# called a shebang. It makes the program
# look more like a C program when it executes
# because instead of running the program by
# first typing the name of the interpreter Python,
# it automatically finds and interpretes the interpreter
# for you. So you type ./<program name> in the command line
# just like in c

print("The shebang is #!/usr/bin/env python3")

# NOTE: After saving this program with the shebang
# execute chmod a+x <file_name>
# in the command line to change the file permission
# then type ./<file_name.py> to run the program
