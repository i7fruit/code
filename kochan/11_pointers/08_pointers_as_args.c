 * This program illustrates the use of
 * pointers as arguments to functions. The
 * pointers are passed by value ie they are
 * copied to the function so any changes to
 * the argument does not affect the pointer
 * that was passed to the function. However,
 * the value that that pointer points to can
 * be changed.
