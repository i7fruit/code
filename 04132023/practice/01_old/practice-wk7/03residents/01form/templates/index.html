        <h1>Residents</h1>
        <p>The form below offers a dummy option that is automatically selected when the page opens.</p>
        <p>It would be a better design to have it disabled after the user clicks to choose an option.</p>
        <p>Again, no action is taken on this form after its submission.</p>
        <form>
            <input name="name" placeholder="Name" type="text" />
            <select name="block">
                <option value="">block</option>
                <option value="Block 1">Block 1</option>
                <option value="Block 2">Block 2</option>
                <option value="Block 3">Block 3</option>
            </select>
        </form>
        <p>
            The "block" option appears like a valid option to be selected. This can be fixed<br>
            by adding the attribute "disabled" to that block option.
